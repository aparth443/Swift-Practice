//..............Closures.....................

//closures are basically inline functions. Similar to lambda expression in other languages. it might take one of this three forms

/*
Global functions are closures that have a name and donâ€™t capture any values.

Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.

Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.

//Example of sorted(by: ) method
//function can be passed to by argument in sorted() method.
let names = ["Chirag","Parth","Gunit","Vikas"]

func sortAsc(_ a:String,_ b:String) -> Bool{
	return a<b
}

var newNames = names.sorted(by: sortAsc)
print(newNames)

//this is not a good idea to write explicit function for a<b line. Instead closure inline function can be used.

//Closure syntax

/*
{ (<#parameters#>) -> <#return type#> in
   <#statements#>
}
*/

var reversedNames = names.sorted(by: {
	(_ a:String,_ b:String) -> Bool in 
	return a>b
})
print(reversedNames)

//Infering type from context

//here sorting takes place on array of string so arguments must be (String,String)->Bool hence swift recognise it.

//no need to specify type and -> in return type
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: {s1,s2 in return s1>s2})
print(reversedNames)

//implicit returns from single-expression closure

reversedNames = names.sorted(by: {s1,s2 in s1>s2})

//here return keyword is not required as only single statement is there in closure

//Shorthand argument names
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: {$0>$1})

//here $0 and $1 represents string arguments

//Operator methods

reversedNames = names.sorted(by: >)

//Trailing Closures

//Using closure in map method of array

		num = num/10

//if multiple trailing closures are there then first one label can be ignored and remaining must be labelled

//Capturing values

//Closures are reference types:

//whenever a function or closure is assigned to some variable or constant then it is assigned as reference.
